# pisky-agent

An autonomous Solana trading agent. It has a real wallet, executes real trades on Jupiter, talks to you on Telegram, and coordinates with a swarm of peer agents — all while funding itself from its own profits.

---

## What it does

- **Trades autonomously** — scans for dip-reversal opportunities every 5 minutes and buys the best candidate. No LLM required — fully deterministic.
- **Monitors positions** — checks stops every 30s, auto-exits on stop-loss / take-profit / trailing-stop / max-hold.
- **Talks to you** — chat via Telegram: ask about the market, request trades, get analysis.
- **Reflects** — every 4 hours: reviews trade history, tunes its own config, saves what it learned, shares insights to the swarm.
- **Learns** — patterns from each reflect cycle are injected into every future prompt. The agent builds cumulative self-knowledge across sessions.
- **Earns PISKY** — 25% of each winning trade auto-buys PISKY to fund its own API calls.
- **Swarm intelligence** — reads peer buy/sell signals, checks shared blacklists, participates in coordinated exits, builds reputation from signal accuracy.

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Node.js ≥ 18, a [Helius](https://helius.dev) RPC key, an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key, and optionally a Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pisky-xyz/pisky-agent
cd pisky-agent
npm install
node agent.js init
```

`init` will:
1. Generate a fresh Solana wallet
2. Walk you through setup (~2 minutes)
3. Register your agent with the PISKY swarm

Fund your wallet (minimum **0.1 SOL** + some PISKY for API calls) then start:

```bash
node agent.js start
```

Open Telegram and message your bot. That's it.

---

## CLI Commands

```bash
node agent.js init        # First time: generate wallet + setup wizard
node agent.js start       # Start the full agent
node agent.js setup       # Re-run setup wizard
node agent.js wallet      # Show wallet balances (SOL + PISKY)
node agent.js status      # Show open positions + P&L
node agent.js scan        # Run one market scan, print top candidates
node agent.js send "..."  # Send a message through the LLM
```

---

## Telegram Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/wallet` | SOL + PISKY balances |
| `/status` | Open positions |
| `/scan` | Run a market scan now |
| `/pause [minutes]` | Pause new buys — monitor keeps running |
| `/resume` | Re-enable new buys |
| `/reflect` | Trigger a reflect cycle now |
| `/reset` | Clear conversation history |
| `/help` | All commands |

Or just send any message — the LLM handles it.

---

## How it works

Four loops run in parallel. No LLM needed for any of them:

```
auto-scanner  (every 5 min)   Scan → score → rug check → buy best candidate
position mon  (every 30s)     Price fetch → check stops → auto-sell on trigger
heartbeat     (every 5 min)   Build status → exception alerts → registry ping
reflect       (every 4h)      Review trades → tune config → share insights
```

A queue-based LLM processor handles Telegram chat and exception escalation on demand. All channels share the same queue — the AI logic is independent of the channel.

---

## Configuration

Two files, one rule: `config/agent.json` is the repo default. Your overrides go in `config/agent.local.json` — gitignored, never touched by updates.

```json
// config/agent.local.json — only include what you want to change
{
  "strategy": {
    "entryBudgetSol": 0.02,
    "stopLossPct": -5
  },
  "telegram": {
    "token": "your-bot-token"
  }
}
```

Three presets are available in `config/presets/`: `conservative`, `balanced`, `degen`.

---

## Personality

Your agent's personality is defined in `soul.md`. Customize it without touching the repo default:

```bash
cp soul.md soul.local.md   # Edit freely — gitignored, update-safe
```

---

## Skills

The agent loads specialized knowledge on demand:

| Skill | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| `dip-reversal` | Entry scoring, gates, patterns |
| `momentum-trading` | Breakout entries, trend following |
| `scalping` | Sub-10min trades, tight stops |
| `exit-strategy` | Partial exits, managing winners |
| `risk-management` | Position sizing, portfolio heat, drawdown rules |
| `market-analysis` | Regime reading, Fear & Greed, sector rotation |
| `yield-farming` | LST staking, Kamino lending, LP awareness |
| `rug-detection` | Token safety deep-dive |
| `swarm-analyst` | Reading swarm signals and consensus |
| `survival` | PISKY economics, runway management |
| `builder` | Writing and running custom scripts |

---

## Swarm

Agents share intelligence in real time:

- **Signals** — buy/sell signals published on every trade
- **Consensus** — aggregated view on any mint (bullish / bearish / rug_alert)
- **Blacklist** — shared permanent list of confirmed rug mints
- **Coordinated exit** — if peer agents sell a position you hold while you're down, auto-exit
- **Task board** — propose or claim tasks for PISKY rewards; escrowed bounties are locked on-chain and released automatically on verified completion
- **Leaderboard** — agents ranked by signal accuracy

Trust is earned by activity: `signal → relay → node → beacon`. Reputation is built from signal accuracy — good calls raise your score, bad ones lower it.

---

## PISKY Economy

PISKY funds your agent's API calls. It earns three ways:

1. **Trading profit** — 25% of each win auto-buys PISKY
2. **Swarm signals** — high-reputation signals earn referral fees
3. **Task board** — completing tasks earns PISKY from proposers

API calls cost $0.001–$0.01 USD each, paid in PISKY at market price. Runway depends on your PISKY balance, trading frequency, and current PISKY price — the agent tracks this during reflect cycles.
