# Skill: Risk Management

How to size positions, track portfolio heat, and protect capital.

## The one rule

**Never risk more than you can afford to lose on a single trade.** Everything else follows from this.

## Position sizing

### Default sizing
`entryBudgetSol` is your fixed position size. Default 0.01 SOL.

That's it. No dynamic sizing needed at the beginner level — fixed size + stop-loss = bounded risk per trade.

### Calculating max loss per trade
```
maxLossSOL = entryBudgetSol × |stopLossPct| / 100
```
Example: 0.01 SOL entry × 6% stop = 0.0006 SOL max loss per trade (~$0.09 at SOL=$150)

### When to scale up
Only scale `entryBudgetSol` up when:
1. Win rate > 50% over ≥20 trades
2. SOL balance > 10× the new position size
3. Market regime is Bull or Ranging (not Bear or Crash)

### When to scale down
Scale to minimum (0.005 SOL) immediately if:
- 3 consecutive stop-losses in the same session
- SOL balance drops below 5× `entryBudgetSol`
- Market regime turns Bear or Crash

## Portfolio heat

**Heat** = total capital currently at risk across all open positions.

```
heat = sum(entryBudgetSol per position) / SOL_balance × 100
```

| Heat | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| < 10% | Cold — room to trade | Normal operation |
| 10–20% | Warm — moderate exposure | OK, be selective |
| 20–40% | Hot — watch closely | No new entries until one closes |
| > 40% | Danger — overexposed | Exit weakest position immediately |

With `maxOpenPositions: 3` and `entryBudgetSol: 0.01` on a 0.1 SOL balance, max heat is 30% — manageable but snug. Raise your balance or lower position count if this feels tight.

## Max drawdown rules

### Session drawdown
If you lose more than 15% of your starting session balance in a single trading session → pause trading for that session.

Use `pause_trading` with reason "session drawdown limit hit".

### Weekly drawdown
If 7-day P&L (from `get_trade_history`) is worse than -25% of starting week balance → reduce `entryBudgetSol` by 50% and raise `minScanScore` by 10.

### Recovery mode
After hitting a drawdown limit:
1. Wait 24h before resuming full position size
2. Start with 50% normal size for the first 5 trades
3. Only return to full size once you're net positive for the week

## Correlation risk

Solana meme coins are highly correlated — when SOL dumps, everything dumps together. This means:

- **Holding 3 positions is not 3× diversification.** It's 3× exposure to the same SOL price direction.
- **Never hold more than 2 positions in the same narrative** (e.g., 2 dog coins, 2 AI coins) — if one rugs on sentiment, the others will follow.
- **When SOL drops > 5% in 1h:** consider exiting all open positions rather than hitting 3 separate stop-losses. One decision beats three.

---

## Stop-loss discipline

Stop-losses are not suggestions. The monitor fires them automatically — never override them via `sell_token` to "give it more room."

Common mistake: moving your mental stop from -6% to -10% after a position goes to -5%. The rule exists because tokens that fall 6% often fall 20% and never recover.

If you find yourself wanting to override the stop: **that's the signal to exit, not hold.**

## PISKY survival as risk management

Your PISKY balance is operational capital — it pays for API calls. If it drops too low, your agent goes blind (no swarm data) and then mute (no LLM).

Risk-manage your PISKY like your SOL:
- < 50k PISKY → load `survival` skill immediately
- Auto-reinvest is your PISKY income hedge — don't disable it

Treat `piskyReinvestPct: 0.25` (25% of every win goes to PISKY) as a non-negotiable overhead, not an optional feature.

## Quick risk audit (run during reflect)

Answer these from `get_trade_history`:
1. Win rate < 40%? → Raise `minScanScore` by 5, raise `minLiquidity` by 25%
2. Avg loss > 2× avg win? → Stop-loss is firing correctly but entries are bad — raise score threshold
3. Max hold firing > 30% of exits? → Market lacks follow-through — shorten `maxHoldMinutes` to 30
4. SOL balance declining week over week? → You are losing more than you're winning. Stop and diagnose before trading more.

## Tools to use for risk checks

- `get_trade_history` — P&L, win rate, exit breakdown
- `check_wallet` — current SOL balance and heat calculation
- `oracle_prices` — SOL/BTC/ETH direction (macro context)
- `market_sentiment` — Fear & Greed (< 30 = extreme fear, pause new entries)
- `pause_trading(reason, minutes)` — enforce drawdown limits programmatically
